# AutoAccepter - This is an AutoAccepter for Dota 2 written in AutoHotkey

The aim of this is to allow me to accept games when I'm alt tabbed or away for short periods of time and don't want to miss the queue.

The script looks for button.bmp and when it finds it presses the enter key (this accepts when the accept button is on screen in Dota 2).
Once the button disappears it will begin searching again.

[Recommended Dota 2 Settings]:

Under Options>Advanced Options I recommend enabling "Bring Dota 2 to front when match found" this will bring the game window back in focus and the script will be able to accept the game.

[Basic guide to getting the script working]:

1. Take a Screenshot of the accept button in view
2. Crop the picture to just the accept button
3. Save picture as button.bmp in images folder (example in images folder)
4. Run Auto Accepter.exe as Administrator for best compatibility, it may work with out it but I always run as admin.
5. Press Ctrl + J to toggle activation and Ctrl + X to close the app
